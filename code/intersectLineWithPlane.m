function [p,t] = intersectLineWithPlane(q,v,w)

% INTERSECTLINES Find intersection of a line with a plane.
%    [P,T] = INTERSECTLINEWITHPLANE(Q,V,W) finds the point of intersection
%    of a line in parametric form (i.e., containing a point Q and spanned
%    by the vector V) with a plane W defined in implicit form. Note,
%    this function does not handle "pathological" cases, since they
%    do not occur in practice with the "shadow scanning" configuration.
